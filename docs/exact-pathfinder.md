# Exact pathfinder

The exact pathfinder is an optional Tile A* backend intended to find routes of
the same cost as the legacy `Pathfinder`. It is selected with the "Pathfinder backend" setting; the default remains legacy. If
exact is selected and fails, the failure is reported; it never falls back to
legacy silently.

## Layout

Exact-core code lives in `src/main/java/shortestpath/pathfinder/exact/`.
`ExactPathfinder` adapts it to the plugin's `ActiveSearch` contract, which the
legacy `Pathfinder` also implements. `PathStep`, `PathfinderResult`, packed
coordinates, collision data and transport types are shared with legacy.

`ShortestPathConfig` owns RuneLite user settings. `PathfinderConfig` owns
client/account refresh, requirement evaluation, transport availability, costs,
wilderness preference, bank-path enablement, bank requirements and the
calculation cutoff. Exact code consumes prepared values and never evaluates
requirements or reads the client directly.

## Data lifetimes

- **Static routing data** (`RoutingStatic`) is derived once per plugin session,
  on the pathfinding thread, the first time an exact search runs
  (`ExactRoutingStaticProvider`, `RoutingStaticBuilder`). It comes from
  `collision-map.zip`, the transport and bank resources, and
  `routing-cuts.bin`.
- **Prepared account data** (`PreparedRoutingAccount`) is compiled from the
  current account state for each search. The `SiteGraph` built from it is kept
  by `ExactRoutingSession` while the account's routing fingerprint is
  unchanged.
- **Per-target data** (`TargetOverlay`, `ReverseLabels`, `PreparedHeuristic`,
  held by `PreparedTarget`) gives an admissible heuristic for one target set;
  see [exact-heuristic.md](exact-heuristic.md). The session keeps recent
  targets for reuse while the graph and collision map are unchanged.
- **Search state** (`ExactForwardSearch`) belongs to one active search.

## Routing cuts

Large walking areas are split into routing components along separator cut
edges stored in `src/main/resources/routing-cuts.bin`. The cuts only affect how
much preparation and search the heuristic needs: cuts that no longer match the
collision map are ignored, so routes stay exact with any cut file, including an
empty one.

The file is generated with KaHIP by the `routingCuts` task in
[shortest-path-tooling](https://github.com/osrs-pathfinding/shortest-path-tooling).
